While there is no out of the box support for Android development on Semaphore,
some components for Android development are readily available.
Among others, Semaphore fully supports [C/C++](c-continuous-integration.html)
and [Java](java-continuous-integration.html) languages without requiring any installation.

There is also a script that you may use in your project to install
and set up the build environment for Android.
The script installs Android SDK, various build tools and emulator, Android system images, etc.
Feel free to explore the script and adapt it to your needs.
You may run the script by adding following to the setup of your project:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/renderedtext/semaphore-scripts/master/android-setup.sh && source android-setup.sh
```

If you need anything, which is not included in the boxes,
feel free to install and download the needed libraries and tools.
The environment grants `sudo` access for this by default.
